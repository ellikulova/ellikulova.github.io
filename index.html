          <p class="abzac">  I live in Athens. Originally from Russia. Usually I work in the season.
               I go to the greek islands. I worked in hotels, restaurants and shops.
               Last place of work was the hotel West East suites as receptionist, also, restaurant Sunsets as a hostess.
                 I had a lot of experience in the online store with electronics in Athens E-shop.gr.
                  I started to make a description of the goods for the store site at home via internet.
                   Later I began to work in the head office as a cashier and also helped in accounting department.
                    For me it was a great experience and I became interested in the computer's programs.
                     Now I start to study the course of  web.design, CSS and HTML. Hope to move in this direction.
                 I am very purposeful, quickly learn and I want to realize myself I think it's never too late. :)</p>
